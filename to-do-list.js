    TO DO:
        15. There isn't really a tie out between quantity/price and the item which is annoying
        16. Export Options?
        19. Max quant for TCG shop is kinda busted -> It needs to know when it has seen a different card (it will count over the maxQUant per card)
        23. Results should really be an object holding multiple shop classes with TCG shop extending class and overriding some methods.
        26. Haven't accounted for free shipping on orders over $5

    Stretch Goals:
        24. Could build out HTML based off the results (UI feels like overkill though)
        25. Incorporate historical data?

    DONE:
